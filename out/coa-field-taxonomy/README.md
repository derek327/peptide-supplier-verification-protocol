# Research Peptide Certificate of Analysis (CoA) Field Taxonomy v1.0

A machine-readable coding scheme for the fields that appear on a research-grade peptide
Certificate of Analysis, with a completeness-scoring rule set.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `coa-field-taxonomy-v1.json` | Full taxonomy: 5 sections, 30 fields, scoring rules, banding, and a list of common omissions |
| `coa-fields.csv` | Flattened field list (section, code, label, requirement, units, notes) |
| `coa-scoring-penalties.csv` | Inconsistency penalties applied on top of the completeness count |

## Method

1. Fields were enumerated from the structure of buyer-grade peptide CoA documents
   (identity, purity/assay, identity confirmation, residuals/safety, storage & traceability).
2. Each field is marked `required` (15 of 30) or `optional`, based on whether a buyer
   can verify identity, purity and batch traceability without it.
3. Five internal-consistency penalties are applied on top of completeness, because a CoA can
   be complete and still not auditable (for example, a declared molecular weight that does not
   match the stated sequence).
4. Completeness minus penalties is banded into four procurement interpretations.

## Intended use

- Normalising CoA documents before a procurement review
- Scoring documentation completeness across suppliers on a comparable basis
- Feeding automated extraction / parsing pipelines

pharmaceutical documentation practice; adapt labels to your own QMS where they differ.
